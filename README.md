# LilyGO-T-ETH-POE (aka: TTGO T-Internet-POE)

## Some information
- The onboard blue LED near the USB-C port is only a power indicator (hard wired between 3,3V and GND)
- You can connect/power the board in 3 ways:
  - Connect the Ethernet interface to a PoE port
  - Connect the Ethernet interface to a non-PoE port and connect the USB-C interface onboard to 5V (power only, no programming interface!)
  - Connect the Ethernet interface to a non-PoE port, attach the programming board to the backside and connect this last one through USB-C or micro-USB to 5V power
